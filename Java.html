        <h1>JAVA</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="color: rgb(63, 217, 255);">What is Java</span>:
            <br>
            Java is a popular programming language used to build various types of applications, such as desktop programs, mobile apps, and web applications. It's known for its simplicity, readability, and platform independence, meaning that Java programs can run on different operating systems.
        </p><p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="color: rgb(63, 217, 255);">Setting up Java:</span>:
            <br>
            To start programming in Java, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. The JDK includes the necessary tools to write, compile, and run Java code. You can download the JDK from the official Java website <a href="https://www.oracle.com/in/java/" target="_blank">oracle.com/in/java</a>.
        </p><p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="color: rgb(63, 217, 255);">Writing your first program:</span>:
            <br>
            Open a text editor and create a new file with the ".java" extension. Let's call it "HelloWorld.java." In this file, type the following code:
        </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              // Example code
              public class HelloWorld {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                  System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                }
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="color: rgb(63, 217, 255);">Understanding the code:</span>:<br><br>

            public class HelloWorld: This line declares a class named "HelloWorld." In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects and organizing code.<br><br>
            public static void main(String[] args): This is the main method. It's the entry point for your program and is executed when you run it.<br><br>
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");: This line prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console. System.out is used to access the output stream, and println is a method that prints a line of text.<br><br>
            Compiling and running the program:<br>
            Save the file and open a command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the directory where the "HelloWorld.java" file is saved. Use the following commands:
            
            javac HelloWorld.java: This command compiles the Java source code into bytecode. If there are no errors, it generates a file named "HelloWorld.class."<br>
            java HelloWorld: This command runs the compiled program. You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed in the console.<br><br>
            Exploring more concepts:<br>
            From here, you can start learning more about Java's syntax, features, and concepts, such as variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and object-oriented programming. There are many online tutorials, courses, and books available that can guide you in your Java learning journey.
            <br><br>
            Remember to practice writing code and experiment with different examples to gain a deeper understanding of Java. Good luck with your Java programming!</p>
